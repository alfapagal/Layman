Dear Colleagues,

We are having one HCI tenant for all the customers, who will be having their individual CF tenants.

Our Application does the following things
Create a user certificate mapping
Authorize the user for whom mapping is created
So that from SAP TM we can send B2B messages through HCI to other systems

We have observed that the HCI overrides the User Certificate Mapping. For example

Let us take a user u1 POSTS a certificate c1 to the HCI tenant from tenant 1 of CF. if some other person from a different tenant 2, posts the same certificate c1 with different user u2. Then the mapping is as follows

Here in the above table when T2 uploads the same certificate C2. Then the entry inserted by the T1 gets overridden.

Unfortunately the response from HCI REST API. Does not have any sign of the certificate getting overridden.

Which can be used by us. For our validation purpose.

Kindly fix this issue
